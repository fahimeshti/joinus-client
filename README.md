# Project Description
This project was created with the purpose of learning and exploring the capabilities of Svelte.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. The frontend of the project was built using Svelte.js, a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. The backend was built using Node.js and it communicates with the database using PostgreSQL, a powerful and open-source relational database management system.

# Features
Built with Svelte.js for a fast and reactive user interface
Uses Node.js for the backend, ensuring fast and efficient data processing
Leverages PostgreSQL for managing and storing data
Implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for data management


# Getting Started
To run this project locally, you need to have Node.js and PostgreSQL installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

Navigate to the project folder and run npm install to install all dependencies
Set up a PostgreSQL database and configure the credentials in the .env file
Run npm run start to start the backend server
Navigate to the client folder and run npm install to install the frontend dependencies
Run npm run dev to start the frontend development server
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000 to see the application in action.

Alternatively, you can access the deployed version of the project on Render by following the link provided in the repository.

# Conclusion
This project is a great starting point for anyone looking to learn about Svelte.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. The combination of these technologies offers a powerful stack for building scalable and efficient web applications. Additionally, deploying the project on Render makes it easier for others to see and interact with the project.
